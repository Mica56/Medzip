        <p class="card-text">The University of Makati, or simply "UMak," assists us in bringing MedZip to the public's attention, notably the university Medical and Dental Clinic, as they are the major players in the platform's growth. The faculty staffs of the College of Allied Health Studies' Center of Pharmacy also assisted in refining the design of this platform so that it could be adequately presented to the users.</p>
